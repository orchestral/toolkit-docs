# Introduction

Packages Toolkit for Laravel is a collection of packages that have been designed to write, test, and preview your Laravel packages.

Before going through the rest of this documentation, please take some time to read the [Package Development](https://laravel.com/docs/packages) section of Laravel's own documentation, if you haven't done so yet.

## Installation

To start using Packages Toolkit for Laravel you can first install the components:

```bash
composer require --dev "orchestra/testbench"
```

Alternatively, if you need to run Dusk tests on your Laravel package you should install the following dependency instead:

```bash
composer require --dev "orchestra/testbench-dusk"
```

### Setup

Next, you can run the following command to scaffold your package with the recommended setup:

```bash
vendor/bin/testbench workbench:install
```
